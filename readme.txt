Display recent Untappd Checkins via widget

== Description ==

This plugin creates a widget that you can use to display recent checkins on Untappd.

**NOTE** You will need to register for an api key from Untappd to use this widget. More information and application can be found at [Untappd API Docs](https://untappd.com/api/)

Available settings will be User name, API client ID key, client ID secret key, and the limit of checkins to fetch.

##Developer notes
Two filters available at the moment:

### untappd_checkins_filter
name of the transient to use for the response caching.
	Default: untappd_checkins
### untappd_transient_duration
how long to store the transients, in seconds
	Default: 60*10 (10 minutes)

##General Notes
Translation ready but I still need to add .pot files.
