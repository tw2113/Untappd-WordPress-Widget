== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Do I find the Brewery or Venue ID? =

You should be able to find the Brewery ID by checking the URL for the brewery on a specific checkin. Hover over or copy the URL for the BREWERY in a checkin like in the following example: "PERSON is drinking a BEER by BREWERY at VENUE" and look for a numeral ID at the end of the URL

You should be able to do the same for a venue ID. Hover over the VENUE in the checkin URL and look for the numeral ID at the end.
